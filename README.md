# Retrival-Augmented-Generation-
This colab Notebook demonstrates the implementation of a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system. The RAG system leverages advanced NLP models to generate contextually relevant responses based on a given query. This is achieved by integrating document retrieval capabilities with state-of-the-art language generation models.

Key Components: Language Models (OpenAI and Langchain Integration): We utilize Langchain to interface with OpenAI's powerful language models. This allows for generating comprehensive responses to various queries.

Document Retrieval (Pinecone): Pinecone's vector database is employed to efficiently retrieve documents that are contextually similar to the input query. These documents serve as additional context for the response generation.

Transformer Embeddings (BERT Model): We use a pre-trained BERT model from Hugging Face's transformers library to generate text embeddings. These embeddings are crucial for the document retrieval process in Pinecone.

Robust Error Handling (Tenacity): To ensure reliability, we implement a retry mechanism using the Tenacity library. This handles potential rate limits or transient errors encountered when interacting with external APIs.

Functionality Overview:

Text Embedding Generation: Converts text to vector embeddings using BERT.

Document Retrieval:Retrieves top relevant documents based on query embeddings.

RAG Response Generation: Generates responses by augmenting the query with retrieved documents and processing through Langchain-enabled OpenAI models.

Retry Mechanism: Uses exponential backoff for robust API interaction.

Testing the System: The system is tested with a sample query to demonstrate its capability in generating context-aware responses.
